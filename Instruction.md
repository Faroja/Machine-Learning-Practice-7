- Use all existing features as input models. Target: 'PRICE'
- Imput missing value if any.
- How is the correlation of each variable to the target?

- Perform splitting with the proportion of 70:30 and random_state = 4.
- Use the Linear Regression model as a benchmark model. Do the modeling using sklearn.
- Original price plots and predictions. Interpret the results.
- What is the distribution of the residuals? Are the assumptions of normality met?

- Perform modeling using Polynomial order 2.
- Compare the results with the benchmark model in terms of its RMSE value.# Machine-Learning-Practice-7
